# User Story: CPU Test Engineer - Writing Test Cases in Chisel

## Description:
As a CPU Test Engineer, I will write and execute test cases in Chisel to validate the CPU design and ensure its correctness across multiple functionalities. The test cases will focus on verifying key aspects of the CPU, including arithmetic logic unit (ALU) operations, pipeline stages, memory access, and control logic. By leveraging Chisel for creating and automating these tests, I aim to identify design flaws early in the development process and ensure the CPU functions as expected under a variety of conditions. This will enable the design team to confidently move forward with iterations and revisions while maintaining high quality and performance.

## Acceptance Criteria:
1. **Test Case Creation in Chisel**  
   - [ ] The CPU test engineer must develop test cases in Chisel that cover a broad range of scenarios, such as basic ALU operations, memory interactions, branch conditions, and corner cases.  
   - [ ] The test cases should be written to verify core functionality such as adding, subtracting, and shifting integers, handling memory reads/writes, and simulating different types of control flow.  
   - [ ] Test cases are designed using Chisel’s built-in testing frameworks (e.g., ChiselTest) and include assertions to validate expected outputs. Each test case is reusable and easy to maintain.

2. **Automated Test Execution**  
   - [ ] The test cases should be executable automatically, ensuring that CPU design correctness is validated with every change made to the design.  
   - [ ] The test suite will be triggered automatically as part of the CPU design’s build process, with results logged in a clear and actionable format.  
   - [ ] The test cases run automatically without manual intervention, and any test failures are logged with detailed information to aid debugging.

3. **Regression Testing**  
   - [ ] Test cases will be integrated into a regression suite that ensures the CPU’s functionality remains intact with every new design revision or feature addition.  
   - [ ] The test suite must re-run whenever new code changes are made to the CPU design, ensuring no regressions or new issues are introduced.  
   - [ ] Regression testing is automated and shows consistent results, ensuring stability across all versions of the CPU design.

4. **Code Coverage**  
   - [ ] The test cases should ensure sufficient code coverage, including the verification of edge cases, control path logic, and any potential design flaws.  
   - [ ] Code coverage tools (such as sbt for Chisel) should be used to ensure that all critical sections of the CPU design (ALU, registers, memory access, etc.) are tested.  
   - [ ] The tests provide high functional coverage, and all critical logic paths are exercised, ensuring the integrity of the CPU design.

5. **Test Case Documentation**  
   - [ ] Each test case should be documented with clear descriptions of its purpose, the inputs it uses, the expected outputs, and what design component it validates.  
   - [ ] Each test case should include comments so that any engineer can understand the scenario it tests, and make necessary modifications in the future.  
   - [ ] All test cases are clearly documented, making them understandable to others and easy to maintain or extend as the CPU design evolves.

6. **Simulation Results Reporting**  
   - [ ] The test cases must produce clear and actionable reports that detail the status of each test case, execution time, and any failures with relevant debug information.  
   - [ ] After running the test suite, the system should generate a report with a summary of the test results (pass/fail), including failure logs that pinpoint issues in the design.  
   - [ ] The results are well-organized, and any failures include sufficient information for the team to investigate the cause and resolve issues quickly.

7. **Performance Validation**  
   - [ ] The test engineer must verify the CPU’s performance by running stress tests and evaluating its performance under various scenarios (e.g., high-frequency operations, memory-intensive tasks).  
   - [ ] Tests should ensure that the CPU design meets the required operational benchmarks, and performance bottlenecks should be identified if they arise.  
   - [ ] The CPU meets or exceeds performance goals, with stress tests running without issues, and any performance limitations are flagged and documented.

8. **Cross-Platform Testing**  
   - [ ] The Chisel test cases should be able to run in different simulation environments (e.g., Verilator, Xilinx FPGA tools) to ensure compatibility.  
   - [ ] The tests should be compatible with multiple tools, ensuring that the CPU design functions correctly across different simulation platforms.  
   - [ ] Test cases are platform-agnostic and can run in various environments without modification, ensuring that the CPU behaves consistently.

9. **Debugging and Failure Analysis**  
   - [ ] The test engineer must be able to effectively analyze test failures and determine whether they are due to the CPU design or the test cases themselves.  
   - [ ] If a test case fails, the engineer should be able to quickly pinpoint the issue, debug the failure, and provide suggestions for fixing it.  
   - [ ] Failures are logged in a manner that allows for fast diagnosis and debugging, and actionable suggestions for fixes are provided.

## Conditions of Satisfaction:
- [ ] Test Case Quality: The Chisel test cases should cover all relevant aspects of the CPU design with specific focus on boundary and edge conditions, control logic, and core functionality.  
- [ ] Automation: Test cases must be automated, integrated into the CPU design’s continuous build process, and run every time there are changes to the design.  
- [ ] Documentation: Each test case is well-documented, with clear descriptions of its purpose and expected behavior, making it easy for others to understand and modify as needed.

- [ ] Performance: The CPU design is performance-tested and meets operational benchmarks under a variety of conditions.  
- [ ] Cross-Platform Compatibility: The tests are platform-independent and run smoothly across different simulation tools and environments.
